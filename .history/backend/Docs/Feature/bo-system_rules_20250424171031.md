# Bayesian Optimization System (BOSystem) Design and Implementation Rules

## Module Overview

BOSystem is the core integration module of the Bayesian optimization engine, responsible for coordinating parameter space definition, initial design generation, observation data management, surrogate model training, and acquisition function optimization components to form a complete Bayesian optimization process. This module implements the iterative loop of Bayesian optimization, including initializing design points, training surrogate models, optimizing acquisition functions, recommending the next experiment point, and processing observation results as key steps.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Various components (parameter space, design generator, surrogate model, acquisition function) interact through clearly defined interfaces
   - Components can be independently replaced, facilitating extension and testing

2. **State Management**:
   - The system completely saves all states during the optimization process
   - Supports serialization and deserialization, facilitating continuation of the optimization process after interruption

3. **Flexible Configuration**:
   - Provides rich configuration options to meet the needs of different optimization scenarios
   - Uses enumeration types and factory methods to create and manage various components

4. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Comprehensive input validation to prevent illegal parameters and states
   - Detailed error messages for debugging and problem diagnosis

## Class Hierarchy and Structure

### Enumeration Types

```python
class AcquisitionFunction(Enum):
    """Acquisition function type enumeration"""
    EI = "expected_improvement"  # Expected improvement
    PI = "probability_improvement"  # Probability of improvement
    UCB = "upper_confidence_bound"  # Upper confidence bound
    LCB = "lower_confidence_bound"  # Lower confidence bound
```

### Main Class Definition

```python
class BOSystem:
    """Bayesian optimization system, integrating parameter space, design generator, surrogate model, and acquisition function"""
    
    def __init__(
        self, 
        parameter_space, 
        objective_names=None, 
        minimize=True, 
        acquisition_function=AcquisitionFunction.EI, 
        acquisition_function_params=None,
        working_dir=None,
        random_state=None
    ):
        # Initialize system components and configuration...
```

## Key Method Implementations

### Initialize Design

```python
def initialize_design(self, design_type, num_samples=None, design_params=None):
    """Generate initial experimental design points"""
    # Create initial design points through the design generator
    # Store design points in optimization history
```

### Add Observation Results

```python
def add_observation(self, design_dict, objectives_dict, constraint_dict=None):
    """Add experimental observation results to the system"""
    # Validate the format and value range of design points and observation results
    # Update optimization history and best solution
    # Mark surrogate model for update
```

### Get Next Design Point

```python
def get_next_design(self, return_type='dict'):
    """Recommend the next experiment point based on current surrogate model and acquisition function"""
    # Update surrogate model as needed
    # Optimize acquisition function to find the best design point
    # Convert to requested return format
```

### System State Management

```python
def save(self, filepath=None):
    """Save system state to file"""
    # Serialize current system state

def load(cls, filepath):
    """Load system state from file"""
    # Deserialize and rebuild system state
```

## Data Flow Description

1. **System Initialization**:
   - Create parameter space definition
   - Set objective functions and constraints
   - Configure working directory and random seed

2. **Initial Design Generation**:
   - Select design type (random, Latin hypercube, etc.)
   - Generate specified number of initial design points
   - Design points are converted to external representation format

3. **Observation Result Processing**:
   - Receive evaluation results for design points
   - Update system history records and optimal solution
   - Mark surrogate model for update

4. **Surrogate Model Update**:
   - Train surrogate model using accumulated historical data
   - Model captures response surface characteristics of the objective function

5. **Acquisition Function Optimization**:
   - Calculate acquisition function values in the design space based on surrogate model
   - Use optimizer to find the optimal point of the acquisition function
   - Return recommended next design point

6. **Iterative Optimization Loop**:
   - Repeat steps 3-5 until stopping condition is reached
   - Return the found optimal solution and complete optimization history

## Code Validation Rules

1. **Parameter Validation**:
   - Validate if parameter space is a valid `ParameterSpace` instance
   - Ensure objective function names exist in observation results
   - Check if acquisition function type is a supported enumeration value

2. **State Consistency Validation**:
   - Ensure sufficient observation data before calling `get_next_design`
   - Validate that added observation results are consistent with parameter space definition
   - Ensure surrogate model training data format is correct

3. **Result Validation**:
   - Validate if recommended design points are within parameter space range
   - Ensure system state consistency before and after serialization and deserialization

## Expansion Plans

1. **Multi-objective Optimization**:
   - Support simultaneous optimization of multiple objective functions
   - Implement tracking and reporting of Pareto front

2. **Parallel Evaluation Support**:
   - Batch recommend multiple design points to support parallel evaluation
   - Implement batch selection strategies considering information gain

3. **Advanced Surrogate Models**:
   - Integrate deep learning and ensemble learning models
   - Adaptively select the most suitable model type for current data

4. **Custom Acquisition Functions**:
   - Support user-defined acquisition functions
   - Implement knowledge-guided acquisition function optimization

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Real-time visualization of optimization process
   - Generate detailed optimization reports and analysis
