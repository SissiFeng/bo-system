  - [x] Getting next suggested design points
  - [x] Prediction with the current model

## 2024-03-10 - Task Management (Phase 5)

- [x] Implemented task state management
- [x] Added persistence for task data (using JSON files)
- [x] Created task status tracking system
- [x] Implemented endpoints for:
  - [x] Listing all tasks
  - [x] Getting task status

  - [x] Exporting task data

## Conclusion

Phases 4 and 5 are now mostly complete. The core Bayesian Optimization engine with Gaussian Process models and Expected Improvement acquisition function is working correctly. Task management with persistence is also functioning properly.

The next development phases will focus on:
1. Implementing real-time notifications via WebSockets (Phase 6)
2. Adding advanced visualization and analysis tools (Phase 7)

See `plan.md` for more details on the upcoming phases.
