Current development progress: 
Core BO Engine (Phase 4): 
BaseModel has been defined in backend/bo_engine/models/base_model.py. 
GaussianProcessModel has been implemented in backend/bo_engine/base_model.py. GaussianProcessModel has been implemented in backend/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine/bo_engine.py. engine/ models/gaussian_process.py. Other models, such as random forests, are currently missing.
The BaseAcquisitionFunction has been defined in backend/bo_engine/acquisition/base_acquisition.py. 
The ExpectedImprovement function has been implemented and is located in backend/bo_engine/acquisition/base_acquisition.py. bo_engine/acquisition/expected_improvement.py. Other acquisition functions such as UCB, PI, etc. are missing.
The core optimizer class (BayesianOptimizer) has been implemented and is located in backend/bo_engine/optimizer.py. It includes methods such as _train_model, suggest, observe, etc.
Phase 4 related API endpoints (/api/results/{task_id}, /api/designs/{task_id}/next, /api/predict/{task_id}, /api/model/{task_id}/performance) are in the backend /app/api/endpoints.py.
Task Management and Strategy Configuration (Phase 5): 
Task state management and persistence logic (e.g., saving and loading files such as task_info.json, strategy.json, results.json, etc.) is implemented in backend/app/api/endpoints.py in several API functions, such as create_parameter_space, set_strategy, submit_results, get_tasks, get_task_status, restart_task, and so on.
Phase 5 related API endpoints (/api/strategy/{task_id}, /api/tasks, /api/tasks/{task_id}/status, /api/tasks/{task_id}/export, /api/tasks/{task_id}/restart) are in backend/append/append/restart. restart) is implemented in backend/app/api/endpoints.py.
Conclusion: 
Phase 4 (Core BO Engine) is almost complete and includes at least one agent model (GP), one acquisition function (EI), core optimizer logic, and associated API endpoints.
âœ… Phase 5 (Task Management and Policy Configuration) is also complete, including task state management, file persistence, and related API endpoints.
According to plan.md, the next development phases are Phase 6 (real-time notifications and advanced features) and Phase 7 (testing, deployment and documentation).
