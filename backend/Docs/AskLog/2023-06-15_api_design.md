# Ask Log: API Design Discussion (2023-06-15)

## Question: API Structure and Endpoint Design

**Q**: We're designing a REST API for our Bayesian Optimization engine. What's the best way to structure the endpoints for parameter space definition, experiment design, and result submission?

**A**: For a Bayesian Optimization API, I recommend structuring endpoints around the optimization lifecycle:

1. **Parameter Space Definition**:
   - `POST /api/parameter-space` to create a new optimization task
   - `GET /api/parameter-space/{task_id}` to retrieve configuration
   - `PUT /api/parameter-space/{task_id}` to update configuration

2. **Optimization Strategy**:
   - `POST /api/strategy/{task_id}` to set strategy (algorithm, acquisition function, etc.)
   - `GET /api/strategy/{task_id}` to get current strategy

3. **Experiment Design**:
   - `GET /api/designs/{task_id}/initial` for initial experiment points
   - `GET /api/designs/{task_id}/next` for next recommended points
   - `POST /api/results/{task_id}` to submit experiment results

4. **Analysis and Monitoring**:
   - `GET /api/model/{task_id}/performance` for model metrics
   - `GET /api/tasks/{task_id}/status` for task status
   - `GET /api/pareto/{task_id}` for Pareto front in multi-objective scenarios

5. **WebSocket for Real-time Updates**:
   - `WebSocket /ws/tasks/{task_id}` for subscribing to real-time updates

This structure separates concerns and follows a logical workflow from setup to execution to analysis.

## Question: Data Storage Strategy

**Q**: Should we use a database or file-based storage for optimization tasks and results?

**A**: For the initial implementation, file-based storage is a reasonable approach:

1. **Pros of file-based storage**:
   - Simplifies initial development
   - Easy to inspect and debug
   - Doesn't require database setup
   - Good for proof of concept

2. **Structure suggestion**:
   ```
   /data/tasks/{task_id}/
       ├── parameter_space.json
       ├── strategy.json
       ├── designs.json
       ├── results.json
       ├── model.pkl
       └── log.json
   ```

3. **Future migration path**:
   - Design with interfaces that abstract storage details
   - Plan to migrate to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) as needs grow
   - Consider SQLAlchemy for ORM to make the transition smoother

4. **When to migrate to a database**:
   - When concurrent users/tasks increase
   - When you need transaction support
   - When you need better query capabilities
   - When data volume grows significantly

This approach gives you a quick start while leaving a clear path to scale as needed.

## Question: Authentication and Security

**Q**: Do we need to implement authentication in the first version of the API?

**A**: For the initial version focused on functionality, authentication can be deferred:

1. **Initial approach**:
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Document authentication as a planned feature
   - Add to technical debt tracking

2. **Security considerations even without auth**:
   - Input validation for all endpoints
   - Rate limiting if exposed publicly
   - Proper error handling to avoid information leakage
   - Logging security-relevant events

3. **Authentication implementation plan**:
   - Plan for API key authentication in the near term
   - JWT support for more complex scenarios
   - Role-based access control for team scenarios

4. **Deployment security**:
   - When deploying, use network-level controls
   - Consider deploying behind an API gateway or reverse proxy
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

This approach lets you make progress on core functionality while having a clear plan for adding security features.

## Question: Scaling Computation

**Q**: How should we handle computationally intensive operations like training surrogate models or optimizing acquisition functions?

**A**: For computation-heavy operations, consider these approaches:

1. **Short term solution**:
   - Use asynchronous endpoints where appropriate
   - Cache results where possible
   - Implement timeouts for long-running operations

2. **Medium term solution**:
   - Integrate a task queue like Celery with Redis
   - Move intensive operations to background tasks
   - Use WebSockets to notify clients of task completion

3. **Long term options**:
   - Implement distributed training for models
   - Consider specialized hardware (e.g., GPU) for certain operations
   - Explore serverless approaches for scaling

4. **Specific optimizations**:
   - Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
   - Use efficient libraries (NumPy, SciPy, BLAS-optimized)
   - Consider approximate methods for very large scale problems

This gives you a staged approach to handling computational scaling as your usage grows.

## Question: Error Handling

**Q**: What's the best approach to error handling and validation in the API?

**A**: For robust error handling:

1. **Request validation**:
   - Use Pydantic for schema validation
   - Add custom validators for domain-specific rules
   - Return detailed validation errors

2. **Error response structure**:
   - Use consistent JSON format for errors
   - Include error code, message, and details
   - For 500 errors, include error ID for tracing

3. **Logging and monitoring**:
   - Log all errors with context
   - Include request ID in logs and responses
   - Set up monitoring for error rates

4. **Business logic validation**:
   - Separate schema validation from business logic validation
   - Use domain objects with validation logic
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 409, etc.)

This approach provides good developer experience while keeping the system robust.
