## Phase 1: Project Initialization and Basic Architecture

### 🚀 Tasks Completed

- ✅ Created project directory structure
- ✅ Set up basic FastAPI application structure (`app/main.py`)
- ✅ Configured logging system (`app/core/logger.py`)
- ✅ Set up configuration management (`app/core/config.py`)
- ✅ Defined Pydantic models for API schemas (`app/api/schema.py`)
- ✅ Implemented API endpoint stubs with placeholders (`app/api/endpoints.py`)
- ✅ Created basic documentation structure
- ✅ Set up Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`)

### 📝 Design Decisions

- FastAPI was chosen as the web framework for its performance, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and support for asynchronous operations
- Configuration uses Pydantic's `BaseSettings` to load environment variables with fallback to defaults
- Logging system supports both console output and structured JSON logs
- In-memory storage is used for the initial implementation but designed to be easily replaced with a database
- Endpoints follow the REST pattern with appropriate HTTP methods for each operation
- Structured the API to match the requirements in `front-back.md`

### 🧩 Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture:

- `app/` contains the FastAPI application and API endpoints
- `bo_engine/` will contain the core Bayesian optimization logic
- Configuration is managed through environment variables
- Data is persisted to the filesystem for now

### 🐞 Known Issues / Limitations

- No proper database integration yet (using in-memory storage and file-based persistence)
- BO engine components are not implemented yet, only API stubs
- Authentication and authorization are not implemented
- No rate limiting or other production-ready features

### 📊 Next Steps

1. Implement `bo_engine/parameter_space.py` to support parameter space definition and validation
2. Implement `bo_engine/design_generator.py` for initial experiment design generation
3. Implement basic unit tests for the parameter space module
4. Update API endpoints to use the actual BO engine components instead of placeholder data
